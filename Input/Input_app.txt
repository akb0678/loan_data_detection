To provide examples of loan applications that are approved or rejected, we can simulate predictions based on a trained model. These examples will demonstrate how various feature values influence the loan status. Below are 10 examples: 5 resulting in approval and 5 in rejection.

Note: These examples are illustrative and should align with the ranges and patterns observed in your dataset.

Key Observations:
Approved Loans:

Low loan_percent_income (indicating affordable loan repayment).
High person_income and credit_score.
Longer cb_person_cred_hist_length and no previous_loan_defaults_on_file.
Rejected Loans:

High loan_percent_income (indicating unaffordable repayment).
Low person_income and credit_score.
Shorter cb_person_cred_hist_length and history of previous_loan_defaults_on_file.
